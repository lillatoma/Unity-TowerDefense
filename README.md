# Tower Defense game
A tower defense game made by zenkii.

## Project background
I planned the project in early August, started it on 25 August 2021 and finished it on 1st September. Well, finished is a relative term as I can always get back to updating/modifying it.  
**Fun fact** My `.` button broke down on my laptop during the making of this game.

## Goal of the game
Survive as many rounds as possible. Each wave of enemies are stronger and stronger. Place turrets to eliminate them. If a turret can't handle the enemies anymore, replace it with a better one, or upgrade it. 30 enemies can be let go.  

## Possible updates
- More enemy types  
- Elementals  
- Background powerups, skill tree, experience system, etc  
- Default placed objects, such as trees, rocks, that can be broken for money  
- More maps
