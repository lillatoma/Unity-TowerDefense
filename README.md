# Tower Defense game
A tower defense game made by zenkii.

## Project background
I started this project at the end of August 2021 and finished it on 1st September. Well, finished is a relative term as I can always get back to updating/modifying it.

## Goal of the game
Survive as many rounds as possible. Each wave of enemies are stronger and stronger. Place turrets to eliminate them. If a turret can't handle the enemies anymore, replace it with a better one, or upgrade it. 30 enemies can be let go.
